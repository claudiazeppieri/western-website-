    <h2>English 2096: Winter is Coming - A Game of Thrones</h2>
    <p>This courses provides an in-depth analysis of George R.R. Martin's fantasy fiction. An emphasis is placed on
    close reading, as one will examine and relate such works to some historical events. Additionally, one will sharpen
        their own analytical and critical evaluative skills, as well as obtain confidence in their research practice.</p>

    <p>From personal experience, I very much enjoyed this course. I am currently reading the A Song of Ice and Fire
    series and am a huge fan of the HBO show. Learning about the many theories and obtaining a deeper sense of what
        could actually be presented in the books has given me more motivation in completing the series.</p>

    <h2>English 3361: Sherlock Holmes and the Fiction of Detection</h2>
    <p>This course primarily focuses on detective fiction present within the nineteenth century. There was an
    elementary focus on Sherlock Holmes and on the overall study of deception. Other topics include: forensic practices,
    surveillance, homicides, and an analysis on the role of being a detective.</p>

    <p>I was extraordinarily interested with the study of forensic science, and did enjoy learning about a different
    genre that I was not formerly introduced to. However, in some classes we did learn about homicides and
    how detectives use deception in solving such crimes. With this, there were moments of discomfort, but I did
    enjoy the concepts that there presented and would recommend for anyone who is interested in forensic and
    evidence practices.</p>

    <h2>English 3300: History of English Language</h2>
    <p>This course differs from most of the English courses that I have taken here at Western. It focuses primarily on
    the historical development of English phonology, morphology, orthography and syntax from Old to contemporary English.
    There is a heightened examination on the evolution of the English language, and the differing varieties of it.</p>

    <p>I cannot say that this course was fully enjoyable, as one does learn an entirely different version of what
    we believe English to be. I did find that this course was extremely educating in how I see English, as I had never
    been aware that there were different forms.</p>
